The following software is released as SOURCE AVAILABLE. Not open source. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is free for individuals and small groups for non commercial and personal use. Contact 
saying what your project is isn't required, but highly desired! I'd love to hear how you 
use my stuff. Credit in your source code and your binary/release files is required. Just 
link this repo! That's all you need. 

It is free for not for profit organizations (i.e. schools, non profit medical facilities,
etc.). Contact for your project is required, just simply stating who you are and what your
project is. Credit in your source code and your binary/release files is required by the
form of a link and name of the repo.

For commercial use where you would make any money from purchases (donations do not and
will never count as commercial use!) of your software, you may not use this software 
under this current license. You MUST contact me to discuss terms of payment for using
this software under a different license. Rates are given on a per use basis and are
based on team, budget size, and potentional revenue gained from the software being
developed. I am willing to work with a significantly smaller initial investment at the 
cost of ongoing royalties! You just have to ask.
